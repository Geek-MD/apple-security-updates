# Apple Security Updates Notifier

Python script that checks for Apple software updates, and notifies via Telegram Bot.

## Basic installation and configuration

First, clone this repo with
  
```
git clone https://github.com/Geek-MD/apple-security-updates-notifier.git
```

Now open ***config.json*** with the editor of your preference and change *"timezone"*, *"bot_token"* and *"chat_id_n"* with their corresponding values.

## Note

This is a first workaround attempt for a persistent bot in the near future.
